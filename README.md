“Refd” is a platform that contributes to reducing food waste in Saudi Arabia. It is a mobile application that connects the two main players in this field, (i) providers who can be restaurants or cafes,… etc. and (ii) consumers who are usually ordinary people. In this platform, providers can offer their discounted surplus foods, providing consumers with many delicious low-price options. Both are financially gainers, and are participating in food sustainability
